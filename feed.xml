&lt;p&gt;As Chuck Harrington, CEO of Parsons Corporation, says: “Richard Rumelt reinforces that a strategy is not a goal or objectives.  It is the battle plan for action that is designed upon a unique set of attributes or conditions (kernels) that sets an organization apart from its competitors (leverages) and results in exceptional and sustainable profits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp’s strategy tree hierarchy, collaboration workboards and org-wide social helps to bring alive this battle plan like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp provides real time, line-of-sight transparency through: strategy &amp;gt; KPIs &amp;gt; people &amp;gt; work … powering org-wide engagement and alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Rumelt</name></author><summary type="html">In our view, this is the all time greatest thinking and resource for developing and executing strategy.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CEOs should stop thinking that execution is somebody else’s job; it is theirs</title><link href="/ceos-should-stop-thinking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CEOs should stop thinking that execution is somebody else’s job; it is theirs" /><published>2019-06-25T05:16:06+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-25T05:16:06+00:00</updated><id>/ceos-should-stop-thinking</id><content type="html" xml:base="/ceos-should-stop-thinking/">&lt;p&gt;Professor Roger Martin is a legend on strategy.

&lt;p&gt;“In my 36 years of working with companies, I still haven’t seen an example of a strategy that was so tightly specified that the people “executing” it didn’t have to make major choices—choices as tricky and important as the so-called “strategy choices” themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp tightens this process of evolving strategic choices and progressively learning from execution, providing a real-time line-of-sight through strategy, KPIs, day to day work and culture.  This elevates collective performance by keeping everyone aligned; from board, CEO and senior management levels, through to middle management, team leaders and front line employees.&lt;/p&gt;

Enter #stratapp, where your strategy and execution can be transparently evolved in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is new is the idea that closing the gap between strategy and execution may not be about better execution after all, but rather about better learning — about more dialogue between strategy and operations, a greater flow of information from customers to executives, and more experiments. In today’s fast-paced world, strategy as learning must go hand in hand with execution as learning — bypassing the idea that either a strategy or the execution is flawed — to recognize that both are necessarily flawed and both are valuable sources of learning, improvement, and reinvention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…a bold vision needs to include both a very ambitious destination and a well-conceived path for execution that will get you there.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Leaders who master both strategy and execution start by building a bold but executable strategy. Next, they ensure that the company is investing behind the change. And last, they make sure the entire organization is motivated to go the journey.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly why #stratapp is not a strategy-only application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp enables all leaders, regardless of their underlying skill orientation, to deliver on both strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp helps cut through this age old dilemma, by bringing the last 7 years of global innovation on collaboration apps, to an org-wide experience that sits within a relevant context of the strategic vision, goals and execution plans.  That is, we have found a way to make that 7 years of  global innovation suitable to mid-market and large corporates, in one seamless UX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no better cure for this energy-sapping trait of human behaviour, than real-time transparency and collaboration at all levels of the organization, within a context of strategy and day to day execution.  Without context, social and work collaboration can just add more noise.&lt;/p&gt;

Town hall meetings are organized, employees are told to change their behavior, balanced scorecards are reformulated, and budgets are set aside to support initiatives that fit the new strategy. And then nothing happens.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s been the way for the last 30 years. Static strategy documents that tend to be communicated top-down and tied to stretch, reasonable or conservative measures/KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see there are two problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, articulated by Freek Vermeulen as: &lt;em&gt;“A real strategy involves a clear set of choices that define what the firm is going to do and what it’s not going to do.”&lt;/em&gt; This point is convincingly argued by Richard Rumelt, mentioned &lt;strong&gt;in our other article.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, is the need to break the age old paradigm of static documents and the terrible human experience of communicating via email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp helps solve both problems, not only by killing internal email. When you start to articulate your strategy inside #stratapp, the transparency and tree hierarchy naturally drives clarity in strategic choices. There are no static documents and all social collaboration takes place within the context of that hierarchy - so instead of just adding more noise, the social engagement, at all levels of the organization, has a direct and meaningful impact on strategic choices, strategy development, execution planning, execution and the evolution of those four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has applied the OKR methodology every quarter since 1999, evolving it to two types of OKRs - committed and aspirational. Google expects 100% results on Committed OKRs and about 70% on Aspirational OKRs, the latter deliberately stretching the capabilities of individuals and the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve aspirational performance, John convincingly argues the case for decoupling salary and bonuses from OKRs, elegantly explained here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/compensation-salary-bonuses-without-okrs&quot;&gt;Compensation The Right Way: Without OKRs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Leaders must get across the why as well as the what. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission.“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There are so many people working so hard and achieving so little.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When people have conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals, they become frustrated, cynical, and demotivated.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With #stratapp, leaders deliver org-wide clarity on the why, direction and goals, coupled with real-time collaboration and transparency on execution. This helps the CEO to bring everyone at all levels in the organization along the same journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs can be cascaded and tracked through a hierarchy of workboards inside #stratapp, with contextual links to the corresponding strategic goals &amp;gt; objectives &amp;gt; actions &amp;gt; projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future we will be adding more features on setting, categorizing, cascading, tracking and reviewing quarterly and annual OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their approach is usually hands-off and justified as building a scalable operating model. That is, most SaaS companies see their core business as scaling lead generation, onboarding and viral growth, alongside ongoing development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a problem for the client: implementation. CRM applications are a great example. Clients get excited at what’s possible during the sales process, then find themselves with a complex product that needs to be configured from a blank shell, and having to select from a range of preferred partners offering different advice, methodologies, resources and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, #stratapp is configured to work ‘&lt;em&gt;out of the box&lt;/em&gt;’, so our preferred partners and the client can focus their energy and resources on proactively managing change and getting their teams fully engaged on what’s possible and understanding how #stratapp will benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On partners, we have decided not to be hands-off. We need partners in order to scale geographically, this is unavoidable. But we are doing it differently. We have developed an implementation methodology for our partners and we have worked out what the implementation coaching costs should be for our clients, at each step in that methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach breaks new ground for SaaS. There are three reasons we are doing this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are walking the talk on genuinely caring about our clients’ success, and to do that we need to directly influence how they are supported by our partners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It removes the pressure on clients, and partners, to negotiate on implementation pricing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It ensures a value for money outcome, for every client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be breaking new ground on communities - how we bring together and collaborate across clients, partners and interested users. We will share more on that later this year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ash Richardson </name></author><summary type="html">SaaS product companies typically lock their clients into a prepaid contract, then leave the client to figure out the implementation by themselves, or with ‘preferred partners’.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Employee engagement without business performance is a fail.
