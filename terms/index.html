				      <h1>terms</h1>

            	<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”, “Terms and Conditions”) carefully before using the <a href="https://stratapp.ai">https://stratapp.ai</a> website and the #stratapp applications (the “Service”) operated by #stratapp Tradings Pty Ltd (“#stratapp”, “us”, “we”, or “our”).</p>

<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.</p>

<p>These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. You warrant that you are at least 18-years-old and you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts. If you are under 18-years-old, you warrant that you have obtained consent from your parent or guardian and they agree to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.</p>

<p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>

<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or #stratapp cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting the #stratapp customer support team.</p>

<p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide #stratapp with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize #stratapp to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, #stratapp will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

<p><strong>Free Trial</strong></p>

<p>#stratapp may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).</p>

<p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>

<p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by #stratapp until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>

<p>At any time and without notice, #stratapp reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

<p><strong>Fee Changes</strong></p>

<p>#stratapp, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

<p>#stratapp will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>

<p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

<p><strong>Content</strong></p>

<p>Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material (“Content”). You are responsible for the Content that you post to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.</p>

<p>By posting Content to the Service, you grant us the right and license to use, modify, perform, display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through the Service. You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person. Further, you warrant that: (i) the Content will not cause you or us to breach any law, regulation, rule, code or other legal obligation; (ii) the Content will not or could not be reasonably considered to be obscene, inappropriate, defamatory, disparaging, indecent, seditious, offensive, pornographic, threatening, abusive, liable to incite racial hatred, discriminatory, blasphemous, in breach of confidence or in breach of privacy; (iii) the Content will not be unsolicited, undisclosed or unauthorised advertising; (iv) the Content does not contain software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software, hardware or telecommunications equipment; and (v): the Content does not bring us or the Service into disrepute.</p>

<p>You agree to keep all records necessary to establish that your Content does not violate any of the requirements of this clause and make such records available upon our reasonable request.</p>

<p>We are under no obligation to regularly monitor the accuracy or reliability of your Content incorporated into the Service. We reserve the right to modify or remove any Content at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Accounts</strong></p>

<p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us with information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>

<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>

<p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You agree to be fully responsible for activities that relate to your account or your password. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.</p>

<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>

<p>The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by users), features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of #stratapp and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the Australia and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of #stratapp. Nothing in these Terms constitutes a transfer of any Intellectual Property rights from us to you.</p>

<p>You are permitted to use the Service only as authorised by us. As a user, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable right to use the Service to create, display, use, play, and download Content subject to these Terms.</p>

<p>Our Intellectual Property must not be used in connection with a product or service that is not affiliated with us or in any way brings us into disrepute.</p>

<p>You must not modify the physical or digital copies of any Content you print off or download in any way, and you must not use any illustrations, photographs, video or audio, or any graphics separately from any accompanying text.</p>

<p>Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by any other users are those of the respective authors or distributors and not of us.</p>

<p><strong>Links To Other Web Sites</strong></p>

<p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by #stratapp.</p>

<p>#stratapp has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that #stratapp shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

<p>We only provide links to external websites as a convenience, and the inclusion of such a link to external websites do not imply our endorsement of those websites. You acknowledge and agree that when you access other websites on the Internet, you do so at your own risk.</p>

<p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.</p>

<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>

<p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

<p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>

<p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

<p>We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any claims or damages arising out of any termination or suspension or any other actions taken by us in connection therewith.</p>

<p>If applicable law requires us to provide notice of termination or cancellation, we may give prior or subsequent notice by posting it on the Service or by sending a communication to any address (email or otherwise) that we have for you in our records.</p>

<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>

<p>As a condition of your access to and use of the Service, you agree to indemnify us and our successors and assigns for all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including but not limited to legal fees and expenses, relating to any claim arising out of or related to your access to and use of the Service or your breach of these Terms and any applicable law or the rights of another person or party.</p>

<p>This indemnification section survives the expiration of your registration, and applies to claims arising both before and after the registration ends.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation Of Liability</strong></p>

<p>You agree that we shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using the Service, copying, distributing, or downloading Content from the Service.</p>

<p>In no event shall we be liable for any indirect, punitive, special, incidental or consequential damage (including loss of business, revenue, profits, use, privacy, data, goodwill or other economic advantage) however it arises, whether for breach of contract or in tort, even if it has been previously advised of the possibility of such damage. The potential business outcomes and benefits included on this Website, and other communications from us, are subject to a range of factors beyond the product itself. For example, client side leadership, the quality of implementation and end user adoption, as well as Porter’s Five Forces as they apply to each client.</p>

<p>You have sole responsibility for adequate security protection and backup of data and/or equipment used in connection with your usage of the Service and will not make a claim against for lost data, re-run time, inaccurate instruction, work delays or lost profits resulting from the use of the Service. You must not assign or otherwise dispose of your account to any other person.</p>

<p>Without limiting the foregoing, in no event will our aggregate liability to you exceed, in total, the amounts paid by you to us.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.</p>

<p>#stratapp its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.</p>

<p>This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injury caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft, or destruction or unauthorized access or, alteration of or use of record in connection with the use or operation of the Service, whether for breach of contract, tortious behaviour, negligence or any other cause of action.</p>

<p>We make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability or availability with respect to the content contained on the Service for any purpose. Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk. We disclaim any express or implied warranty representation or guarantee as to the effectiveness or profitability of the Service or that the operation of our Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. We are not liable for the consequences of any interruptions or error in the Service.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusions</strong></p>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>

<p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>

<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Queensland, Australia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect.</p>

<p>It is your sole responsibility to periodically check these Terms for any changes. If you do not agree with any of the changes to these Terms, it is your sole responsibility to stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service will be deemed as your acceptance thereof.</p>
