<p>#stratapp applies what most CEOs, executives, managers and team leaders already know.</p>

<p>The Strategic Planning tree cascades as: goals &gt; objectives &gt; actions &gt; projects.</p>

<p>At each tree level you can assign different owners, teams, workboards, tasks and KPIs.</p>

<p>KPIs can be strategic or day to day, quantitative or qualitative. KPIs can be viewed as their own hierarchical tree (which automatically overlay onto a Live Org Chart), indented list or balanced scorecard.</p>

<p>The #stratapp Live Org Chart allows for direct and indirect reporting lines, the latter for 2nd hat roles or matrix reporting.</p>

<p>As you would expect, risks are tracked on status, probability, impact and mitigations.</p>

<p>#stratapp live notes come with a purpose, agenda and clock.</p>

<p>Meeting actions automatically appear in your workspace - so if you attend six meetings in a day, you don’t need to go back to the notes of each meeting to see your actions.</p>

<p>Every module in #stratapp tracks the creator, owner and assignor, with powerful filters, sort and search across the whole app - so you can easily follow-up on work you have assigned to others or what you are responsible for right now.</p>

<p>Everything you need, 10-apps-in-one as a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>A similar explosion of choice happened with enterprise software, fuelled on by the niche focus of venture capital and group think.</p>

<p>Now, as we approach 2020, for both consumer and enterprise the trend is reversing. Consumers are organizing their smartphones around the apps they really need, and companies are trying to rationalize proliferation. Companies don’t want to send employees to 10+ different apps in order to do their jobs.</p>

<p>In the small business segment, a great example of a consolidated SaaS approach is the impressive product <a href="https://keap.com/keap" title="https://keap.com/keap" target="_blank">https://keap.com/keap</a> - covering the whole cycle from managing leads, to doing the work, getting paid and staying connected, all in one app.</p>

<p>Predicting this reversal some years ago, the founders of #stratapp planned from the outset to roll 10-apps-into-1, as the starting point. To achieve this we had to create a UX design construct that is visually and interactively consistent across the whole application. We then took it to the next level - making the 10-apps-in-1 seamlessly interact with each other.</p>

<p>#stratapp takes sharing freely to the next level.</p>

<p>Since 2010 the world has seen incredible viral adoption of work collaboration apps. We estimate there are more than 100m users worldwide on the likes of Trello, Asana, Atlassian, Aha! and Basecamp. These clever apps remain mostly unheard of by corporate executives and tier-1 management consultants - and those that have heard of them, have difficulty articulating how they work or why they have become so popular. That is because all of these work collaboration apps were predominantly designed for teams of less than 15 people. By our estimate, 8-15% of employees are skilled in one or more work collaboration apps; usually those employees who work in digital, product or technology functions.</p>

<p>#stratapp changes everything, bringing this global innovation to add value to 100% of employees. We have improved on best practices and UX design to make these powerful work collaboration capabilities available to all levels of the organisation, including varying employee aptitudes towards technology. We have also added the categorisation, filters, sort, search, org structure and security features you expect as an org-wide app for 5 to 500,000 employees.</p>

<p>We then made these global best practices in work collaboration, the underlying org-wide experience for collaborating on strategy and execution - designed in a way that meets the expectations of both the current and next generation workforce.</p>

              <div class="h5 mb-3 shrinkable"><p>Social apps without context or structure, just add more noise. Especially as you move above 50 employees into mid-market and corporates. Social fast becomes a twitter-style fire hose of notifications, or like being on the end of hundreds of reply-all emails per day.</p>

<p>#stratapp has found a way to embrace the power of social - but with context and structure.</p>

<p>In #stratapp, most social interaction takes place within either the strategic plan or KPI hierarchy, or the individual cards for notes, tasks, risks, ideas and challenges. This naturally organizes what conversations relate to what, and why - in doing so, it kills about 90% of internal email.</p>

<p>With #stratapp, social has structure. We were inspired by the early innovations of Stride, since acquired then buried by #slack. We’ve ratcheted the innovations of Stride up a notch. When you post or reply inside #stratapp, you can tag it as a comment, agree, disagree, question, task, risk, idea, decision, approval or something to note.</p>

<p>You’ve probably already figured out why. Not everyone in a 50, 500, 5,000 or 50,000 employee organization wants to sift through hundreds of social notifications to find exactly what they need to know. People also don’t want to open and browse each module individually (e.g. strategy, KPIs, risks, ideas and workboards).</p>

<p>So, we have extracted all social to one place. You can immediately get to exactly what you are interested in. For example, “I want to see any questions, decisions or approvals made in the last 72hrs on anything to do with our strategy.” That takes 4-5 seconds to do inside #stratapp. Of course, what you can see is subject to security settings.</p>

<p>The same goes for workboards. Whilst there might be 25 users busy and deeply engaged on a project workboard, you may not want to scroll through hundreds of notifications to keep track. Workboards in #stratapp have their own dedicated social page, where you can quickly filter to what you are interested in, for example, “I want to see any ideas, risks or questions asked on a task where I am a member of that task card.”</p>

<p>Recapping, #stratapp’s social has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Context - naturally organizing conversations where they belong</li>
  <li>Structure - so you can find exactly what you are interested in</li>
  <li>Filtering - so you don’t need to go searching or scrolling to catch up</li>
  <li>Workboard social page - so you can easily keep up and engage with the project</li>
  <li>Security - protecting the organization’s IP and who can see what</li>
</ul>

              <div class="h5 mb-3 shrinkable"><p>#stratapp puts “your company in your pocket!”</p>

<p>That phrase is not our only inspiration from the late Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs had a passion for smartphone UX design that takes into account user mode (what they are trying to achieve) and physical interaction (how they interact with devices).  His thinking was that in certain user modes (e.g. couch surfing), the primary navigation on smartphones should be within thumb reach, and easily workable with the device held in only one hand.</p>

<p>#stratapp has embraced this design philosophy, soon discovering that it is easier said than done once the user travels below the first level nav.  11 design iterations later, we cracked it.</p>

<p>Firstly, we have made sure that the mobile versions (IOS and Android) are rich in functionality, rather than a minimalist version of the desktop app.  Why?  People are increasingly mobile and #stratapp is an integral part of their everyday work.  So you will find on the mobile apps, nearly every feature you see on desktop.</p>

<p>Our primary nav on mobile scrolls left-right at the screen bottom, with thumbs easily reaching the level 2 and 3 nav just above that.</p>

<p>When you open the mobile app, we assume you are on the move, in a cafe/bar/restaurant or kicking back on the sofa.  So the primary nav on the landing screen, takes you straight to what you are most likely to browse with one hand: social, alerts, notifications and pinned items.</p>

<p>The second mobile screen takes you straight to day to day work - what you have on this week, notes, tasks and boards.</p>

<p>The third screen brings up headlines, the strategic plan, KPIs and people.</p>

<p>As you dive into each aspect of the app, we keep to the philosophy of Steve Jobs.  Sub-menus, filters and back-buttons are within thumb reach, and can be operated with one hand.  However, when you go from couch surfing to performing work (e.g. typing a message, adding a task or creating a meeting note), the navigation and cursor placement assume you are now in a different user mode and holding the device with two hands.</p>

<p>By applying these design principles, we have strived to deliver a mobile experience akin to progressive consumer apps.  Thereby hopefully exceeding the expectations of all ages, from y-generation interns through to seasoned executives.</p>
